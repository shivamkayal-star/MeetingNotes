Call Notes w/ Sam | 09/02
Hi team,
 
Please find below the notes from the call with Sam:
 
Offsets>
Panama’s Ministry of Environment issued a moratorium on forest carbon projects while setting up its voluntary market
Patch deprioritized Panama sourcing
Carbon team not confident in moving forward with Panama
Sam also agreed on holding on Panama projects
TIST: Sam agreed to not proceed with TIST DD for now
Advanced DD: If any suitable project (even IFM) emerges, consider advanced DD
Washington Rainforest Project: Sam suggested buy-and-hold strategy (not immediate retirement); Ensure resale rights included in contract; Carbon Team to confirm purchase volume (20K vs 30K tons) with rationale before placing order
Business Travel Intensity Projections>
Narrative: Even with modest growth, projections show Bain must act to meet SBTi/2030 targets
Stronger case if intensity rises over time. This creates “burning platform” urgency
By 2028–2030, scenario shows overshoot, reinforcing need for action
Scope 1 & 2 levers: Casey suggested Angela West as good contact for sustainability related questions; Stronger than Peter Gray for LEED, retrofits, and office certifications; Use LEED building efficiency benchmarks by market to estimate improvements. Back-of-the-envelope calculations based on carbon footprint data + LEED averages.
