Call Notes w/ Sam | 08/19
Hi team,
 
Please find below the notes from Sam’s call:
 
MSCI tool>
Sam aligned with BCN's assessment that it is unclear if Bain is receiving sufficient incremental value to justify additional costs from MSC
Action: Thank MSCI, tell them to stay in touch, but no additional commitment at this stage
Monitor developments from other providers. Renoster is planning a public release soon. Patch is exploring API-related capabilities.
Carbon Pulse and Quantum Carbon Daily continue to push daily news platforms
Offset Tracker Dashboard>
Idea: Explore integration with Silvera or BZero for automated data feeds
Keep Offset Tracker internal for now, but continue monitoring opportunities for automation
Carbon Budget Dashboard>
Sam to send out the email notification about the new Carbon Budget Dashboard link. BCN to share OFT with him.
Email should have: Bain-level update on progress toward targets (“tracking forward, good progress”); Guidance on usage: encourage teams to factor carbon implications into financial planning and travel/meeting decisions
The new link to the dashboard
Keep similar to last year’s update
Tracera Pilot>
Sam aligned with the overall plan
Suggested to have 3 CDMs for the pilot
