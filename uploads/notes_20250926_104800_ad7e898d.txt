Ben to ask CIP the following questions:
Vintage and pricing for the offered projects
For the Panna Afforestation and Reforestation Project:
To get clarity on the revenue streams associated with this project, since we have concerns regarding the viability and reliability of agroforestry projects and their respective credits generated
The expected timelines for the validation and verification reports, as well as the issuance of carbon credits
To confirm whether they are offering spot credits or if it is limited to offtake agreements for this project
Microsoft bought project has a good stamp of quality but concerns regarding:
Agroforestry projects - Concerns around additionality
Leakage assumptions
Barely generating any credits per year
Decisions regarding projects:
Panna Afforestation and Reforestation Project: Decision will be made based on the responses received from CIP
Ben agrees with rejecting the remaining 3 projects:
Hongera Reforestation Project: Generating minimal credits
Greenzone Reforestation Project: Generating minimal credits
Manglares Ursulo Galvan Project: Mexico Mangroves; weak additionality; previously rejected

Scope 1&2:
No more scenarios needed
Sensible option would be to stick to our Minimum % or McKinsey Target
Scope 3:
Only Air travel volume reduction is in our hands
EoVs - Our methodology has to account for change in EoV landscape
If we do encourage people to buy EVs - we need to account for this in our methodology
The levers that Bain has control over:
Travel less
Buy SAF - huge lever
Hired Cars/ Uber and Lyft
