Call Notes w/ Casey | 08/04

Hi Team,
 
Please find below the notes from the call with Casey:

GOC Deck>
Casey is helping setup GoC deck for Aug for the slides Sam wants to present
No current topic from our team is being discussed, so no slide from our end
Casey might ask for help if they need anything from Carbon side
Casey mentioned the reporting team is evaluating a new risk tool (WWF Risk Tool)
We need to tell Casey about Lignaverde, if we have any context. Else, they will check with Sam directly.
