Call Notes w/ Sam | 08/28
Hi team,
 
Please find below the notes from the call with Sam:
 
Carbon Budget>
Nature-based Offsets: Current price for 2025 is $32. Sam aligned to proceed with the $32 figure
Surcharge Recovery:
2024 recovery: $5.4M
2025 Projection: ~$8.3M recovery from surcharge
To fully cover budget surcharge would need to rise
5% starting rate was in 2024; Sam to confirm current % and January 2025 adjustment
Question: If rate rises further in Jan 2026, how much recovery would that bring (assuming stable base revenue)
Patch Advanced DD>
Sam aligned to ask Patch for Advanced DD on Generation Forest methodology
For TIST, not seeking advanced DD; Just insights on a few specific questions
Building Survey>
Sam aligned with all three assessments (1 for Montreal and 2 for Ho Chi Minh)
BCN team to share the results with Peter Gray
SBTi Near-term Target>
Scope 3 BT: Flat trajectory did not seem right to Sam. Suggested to explore using current 2025 projections; Or may be extend incremental increases observed in 2023–2025 through 2030.
