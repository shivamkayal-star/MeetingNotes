Hi Estabrook, Ben,
 
Hope you are doing well!
 
Please find below the EoD notes for today:

The changes discussed in yesterday's call have been incorporated
[Input required] Could you please provide feedback on the survey responses?
Our understanding is that we will be filling out the survey on Sam's behalf. Given that tomorrow is the last working day before the survey submission deadline (1st June), we need to complete and submit the survey tomorrow
