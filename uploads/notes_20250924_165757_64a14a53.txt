Platform walkthrough
Customize and manage location data through the Add Site interface
Deactivated meters and utility providers retain historical data; new ones can be added as needed
Audit trail records all changes and sign-offs

Module admin: Full platform permissions (edit, delete, assign roles, lock data)
Data provider: Can upload and edit utility data only for assigned sites; Cannot add sites or users
Data validator: All permissions of the data provider, plus the ability to review and sign off on the data
Shivam added as Module Admin; team will assign additional users
AI performance improves with more recent and complete data
Current Excel upload requires use of a defined template, and a more flexible “ingestion wizard” is under development to support unstructured Excel files
Multi-tenant site: Currently manually calculate and input their proportional share
Future enhancement: Users will be able to assign a fixed allocation percentage per account number
Emission Factors
Emission factors visible under Resources – References
Users can view: Factors by site, utility type, region; GWP assumptions and CO2 conversion logic
Multiple databases supported (e.g., IEA, EcoInvent), but the platform team must pre-configure the chosen database
Only selected factors will be visible for reporting
Next steps: BCN to upload utility invoices by tomorrow and notify Tracera
Next meeting: Explore the platform in more detail; Review AI training progress; Address new questions; Scope 3 Discussion
