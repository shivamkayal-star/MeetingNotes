Call Notes | 06/25
Hi Estabrook, Ben,
 
Please find below the notes from today's call (06/23):
 
DEFRA 2025 update>
McKinsey feels that DEFRA has made a mistake with the WTT factors
They have reached out to DEFRA to confirm this
Ben feels we should also reach out regarding the same
We can explore using different base and WTT factors (2025 base factors, 2022 WTT factors)
Confirm with EcoOnline whether this is feasible on the portal or not
To prepare 3 slides for Sam with factor variance and emission implication
Only TTW factors
Only WTT factors
WTW factors (Total)
 
SBTi Near-term target setting>
SAF:
To update cost for SAF - $99/ton (Southwest) and $191/ton
We can consider showing a range ($100-200)
Total cost and incremental cost to be shown separately
We are already buying 5% SAF - SAF85
Cost of SAF 85 is higher
In addition to this, how much more incremental SAF do we need to purchase
 
Eligibility Requirements:
SBTi requires a number for oil and gas revenue and wants it to be substantiated as well
Do we need separate document for different data points or a single document?
 
AMEX-CWT Duplicates>
Double counting CWT since 2024
No change to 2024 assessment
Ben is aligned with removing CWT from consideration (90% duplicates)
We should switch to GBT entirely
To prepare the following for Linda and Celia
Data to substantiate 90%
A summary table
Detailed examples for all the issues:
Full list of missing PNR
List of matching PNR and mismatched mileage
Flag good mismatches
0 mileage issues
