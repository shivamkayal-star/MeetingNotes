SBTi Survey > https://bainandcompany.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Global_Sustainability_At_Bain_Teams/EUC0t0ASSOtMpuFVA99ZL_cBnzatvs0tQYPHGTSuQS-SUQ?e=cFLtSt
Separating Scope 1 and 2 targets can increase complexity and burden of managing multiple targets
Recognition that scope 1 reduction will be harder without market based instruments like renewable natural gas certificates
For reporting full scope 3 inventory we can report the rest of categories as zeroes as they do not apply to Bain
We have added a response opposing separate scope 1&2 targets and physical intensity metric only for emission intensive activities
Context for Scope 3 near term target setting:
For emission intensive activities, targets were to be set separate, but since that is not applicable to us now anymore we will just have a collated target for scope 3 relevant emission sources
'C16.1. Companies shall set near-term scope 3 targets that cover all relevant scope 3 emissions sources as defined in CNZS-C7. (NOTE: The SBTi is consulting on whether long-term scope 3 targets should be required in addition to near-term targets and the net-zero commitment in C1.3.) C16.2. Companies shall separate targets for emissions-intensive activities [representing X% or more of total scope 3]. (NOTE: The SBTi is consulting on whether activity-level targets on emissions-intensive activities should be mandatory and, if so, at what threshold.) C16.3. Companies may aggregate targets for remaining scope 3 emissions into a single target.'
[Input required] Could you please provide feedback on the survey responses?

Aim at setting targets at least similar to McK and then see what else we can achieve
