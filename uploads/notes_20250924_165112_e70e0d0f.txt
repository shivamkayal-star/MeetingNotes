Call Notes w/ Sam | 08/06

Hi Team,
 
Please find below the notes from the call with Sam:

SBTi near-term target>
Sam asked to finalize the SBTi near-term deck for September GOC
Internal carbon price model>
Sam said that multiple confounding factors are affecting carbon offset costs: Inflation; US tax credits, especially on SAF
Sam said current $188/t base assumptions may be too optimistic; suggests taking the average of the last 3 years
New base price: $230/t
Inflation rate: 3% annually
Sam suggested ramping costs gradually over time to avoid large price shocks later
Sam suggested using contractual emissions reductions as a proxy for client-driven SAF demand
Casey informed that currently only 2–3 client contracts include explicit emissions reduction language; estimated impact: <200t
Casey to quantify current contractual reductions
