Call Notes w/ Sam | 08/26
Hi team,
 
Please find below the notes from Sam’s call:
 
Carbon Budgets Dashboard Email>
Sam to share the carbon budget dashboard email. No changes required.
AI Emissions Projections>
Could updated estimates be ready before Sept 18 call?
Ideas:
Use PG&S data
Use OpenAI subscription annual cost and use better emission factor
Estimate emissions per request × number of requests (approximate)
Two triangulation approaches could yield comparable ranges
Earliest update feasible: Sept 12
Casey suggested to add note that updates are WIP
If near final estimates, include directly; otherwise frame as WIP
Casey suggested TSG may have better tracking of query volumes than current PG&S view
Task: Review different emissions factors available and identify useful metrics
Agreement: team to share major emission factors + activity links in a few days
Fees Discussion>
Isometrix fees: Total = $30,000; Half is fixed fee; Half is tied to offset purchase
BeZero fees: check if additional cost for any data point
Internal Carbon Price Model>
Increase Offset growth to 10%
Emissions: 174,000 this year to 161,000 next year in model. Team to recheck spreadsheet, verify data updates.
Client Carbon Recoveries>
Present estimate is doubling first-half recovery
Actions: Compare first half of prior year vs. this year to refine projection
For next year: triangulate with air/business travel projections + fee structure
Question: whether to increase fees next year
