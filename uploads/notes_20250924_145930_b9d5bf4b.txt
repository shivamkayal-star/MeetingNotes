Call Notes w/ Sam | 08/21
Hi team,
 
Please find below the notes from Sam’s call:
 
TIST Projects – Advanced DD>
Carbon team to check if there is any project that could warrant advanced DD; if not, we can go ahead with TIST DD
VCS 1764 and VCS 2088>
VCS 1764: If Silvera’s reassessment comes back with a reasonable answer, this project remains worth pursuing
VCS 2088: High risk right now. Team decided to not commit despite attractive pricing. Keep tracking, revisit in September if more clarity emerges.
SBTi near-term target>
Casey raised a key question on whether RNG Certificate is realistically achievable by 2030
Confidence in RNG adoption is not yet strong enough to treat it as guaranteed; this needs to be reflected in the storyline for targets
Carbon team to share deck with Sam and Casey
