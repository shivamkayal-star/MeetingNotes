Hi team,
 
Please find below the notes from Sam’s call:
 
California Disclosure>
Sam is aligned with the California disclosure
Disclosing vendor names:
Recommend adding clarity in offsets contracts to ensure vendors understand disclosure terms
Specify that vendors cannot use Bain’s name on their portals without prior approval
Offsets>
Sam would like to keep three reject projects under consideration with refreshed due diligence:
Tropical Mix: Suggests we may have been overly cautious on agroforestry risks
Ethiotrees: Sam likes the project; believes communal conflict may not materially affect project location and credits generation
Generation Forest: Recommends monitoring Panama developments closely as it might not impact credit issuance, as contracts will be signed to secure it
Additionally, Sam believes TIST Uganda might not be highly problematic as contracts will be signed to secure credits; only concern is bundled vintages
Sam is aligned with the overall action plan
